# Online Competitive Examination System - Backend API

This project provides a complete REST API backend for an Online Competitive Examination System, built using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.
 
## Features
- Role-based authentication (Admin and Student) using JWT.
- Exam management (CRUD operations on topics, exams, questions, and options).
- Student exam portal (view available exams, start exam, answer questions, submit exam).
- Automatic evaluation system to calculate marks and percentages on submission.
- Real-time exam status tracking (IN_PROGRESS, SUBMITTED).
- Result generation and dynamic ranking calculations using SQL window functions.
- Secure password storage with bcrypt.

## Architecture & Technologies
- **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
- **Web Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL 8+ (raw parameterized SQL via `mysql2` driver; no ORMs)
- **Security:** `helmet` for HTTP headers, `cors` for cross-origin sharing, `bcrypt` for password hashing, and `jsonwebtoken` for stateless auth.

## Database Schema & ER Relationships
The system consists of the following entities: `admin`, `student`, `topic`, `exam`, `question`, `question_option`, `attempt`, `answer`, and `result`.
- **Admin** manages **Exams** and **Topics**.
- **Exam** belongs to a **Topic** and contains multiple **Questions**.
- **Question** contains multiple **Question Options**.
- **Student** can make **Attempts** on **Exams**.
- **Attempt** records the student's progress and contains multiple **Answers** to the Exam's Questions.
- **Attempt** maps 1-to-1 to a final **Result**.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **MySQL Setup:**
   Ensure MySQL is running on your machine.
   Load the schema and seed data into your MySQL database:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql
   mysql -u root -p < database/seed.sql
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   Copy the example environment variables file and update it with your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   *Edit `.env` to match your MySQL credentials.*

## Running the Server

Start the server in development mode using nodemon:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or start in production mode:
```bash
npm start
```

## API Documentation

Test these endpoints using Postman or Thunder Client.

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/student/register` - Register a new student
- `POST /api/auth/student/login` - Student login
- `POST /api/auth/admin/login` - Admin login

### Admin Flow (requires Admin JWT)
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard` - Get overall system statistics
- `POST /api/topics` - Create a topic
- `POST /api/exams` - Create an exam under a topic
- `POST /api/questions` - Add a question (with its options) to an exam
- `GET /api/admin/students` - View all registered students
- `GET /api/admin/attempts` - View all exam attempts
- `GET /api/admin/results` - View all evaluation results
- `GET /api/results/exam/:examId` - View all results for a specific exam
- `GET /api/ranking/exam/:examId` - View ranking for a specific exam

### Student Flow (requires Student JWT)
- `GET /api/student/exams` - View all currently active exams available for the student
- `POST /api/student/exams/:examId/start` - Start an exam
- `POST /api/student/attempts/:attemptId/answer` - Submit an answer to a question
- `POST /api/student/attempts/:attemptId/submit` - Finish the exam and trigger evaluation
- `GET /api/results/my-results` - View all past results of the logged-in student

### Testing Instructions
Sample users are seeded in the database:
- **Admin**: `admin1@example.com` / `password123`
- **Student**: `student1@example.com` / `password123`

To test the complete flow:
1. Hit `GET /api/health` to verify server/database connectivity.
2. Login as a student to receive a JWT.
3. Pass the JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for subsequent requests.
4. Call `GET /api/student/exams` to find an exam ID.
5. `POST /api/student/exams/:examId/start` to begin.
6. Provide answers to questions using the generated `attempt_id`.
7. Submit the exam. The backend will evaluate and calculate your score.
